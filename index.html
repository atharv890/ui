The boys' hostel with the capacity for 40 residents is located within the premises of KC Sports Club adjacent to the school campus. It is a fully air-conditioned facility. Resident girls are accommodated in a separate building within the school campus. The facility has been provided essentially to cope with demand for admissions from remote areas of Jammu & Kashmir such as Ladakh and Indo-Pak border.

                The hostel premises are well maintained by in-house staff and the children are looked after by responsible and caring wardens. The mess facility for residents is first rate and is supervised by a qualified and experienced mess manager.</p>

                <h4><mark> <i> <sup> <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i></sup>Lawn Tennis was re-introduced as a major sport in the school from the academic year 2012-13. The old RCC surfaced Tennis court located in the Sports Complex was re-constructed by a Delhi based company of world repute with a nine-layered synthetic surface in 2012. This surface compares with the best synthetic surfaces laid anywhere in the world of today for sporting competitions including the Asian Games and the Olympics. In the academic year 2013-14, we converted one of our existing Basketball courts into a synthetic surface Basketball-cum-Lawn Tennis court. We are the first school in the entire State of Jammu & Kashmir to provide world class Lawn Tennis facility for our students. Both boys and girls of the school are trained in Lawn Tennis by qualified coaches. <sup> <i class="fa fa-quote-right"> </i></sup></i></mark></h4>
